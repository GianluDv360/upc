# Data Analysis with Pandas

## Introduction
In this notebook, we will explore various aspects of Data Science, including the languages and libraries used in this field, arithmetic expressions, and more.

## Data Science Languages
The following programming languages are commonly used in data science:
- Python
- R
- SQL
- Julia
- Scala

## Data Science Libraries
Some popular libraries used in data science include:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Data Science Tools
Here is a table listing some popular tools used in data science:

| Tool          | Type         | Purpose                        |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Jupyter      | IDE          | Interactive computing          |
| GitHub       | Versioning   | Code version control           |
| TensorFlow   | Library      | Machine learning framework     |
| Tableau      | Software     | Data visualization             |
| Excel        | Software     | Data analysis and manipulation |

## Arithmetic Expression Examples
In this section, we will demonstrate how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Python.

# Multiply and add numbers
a = 5
b = 3
## Display results
a * b = 15

a + b = 8

# Convert minutes to hours
def convert_minutes_to_hours(minutes):
    hours = minutes / 60
    return hours

minutes = 120

convert_minutes_to_hours = 2.0

## Objectives
The objectives of this notebook are:

- Learn about data science languages and libraries.
- Understand basic arithmetic operations.
- Convert units (e.g., minutes to hours).
- Work with tools used in data science.
